                <h2>Spring, 2025<br>
                Group Project</h2>
                <br><br><br>

                <h3>Project Description:</h3>
                <br>
                <p>People Helping People was a website design project
                assigned during the spring semester, 2025. This project
                hypothetically served as a way to better connect people
                who would need help, such as the elderly or disabled, with
                volunteers. The problem proposed in the beginning was the
                imaginary client, a non-profit community foundation named
                People Helping People, relied on phone calls to connect users
                and spreadsheet. Us as the designers were assigned to streamline
                the process with the user in mind. The solutions proposed was a
                matching system which includes user profiles and filling out forms
                to connect users with each other.</p><br><br><br>

                <h3>Design Process:</h3><br>
                <h4>1. Personas</h4><br>
                <p>To start, the potential target users were considered. Three
                    personas were created to represent possible prominent users:
                    disabled, elderly and volunteers.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h4>2. Wireframing</h4><br>
                <p>After taking the users into account, designing the website came
                next. Aspects of the website were created through wireframing with
                Figma such as:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Form and profile pages</li>
                    <li>Possible layouts</li>
                    <li>Typography and colors</li>
                </ul>
                <br><br>
                <h4>3. Prototype</h4><br>
                <p>Lastly, I along with a small team built the website using the
                wireframes prior. This was done through standard HTML and CSS.
                My contribution on the project was the design and implementation
                of the home and profile page for the website.</p>

            <div class="php-images-container">
                <div class="php-image-1"></div>
                <div class="php-image-2"></div>
            </div>

            <div class="php-images-container-2">

            <div class="php-text-container">
                <h3>Challenges & What I've Learned</h3><br>
                <p>A difficulty of the project for me was figuring out how the system
                would theoretically work and what elements should be included for the
                user experience. Ultimately, we decided to keep it simple. The users would
                be able to request assistance as well as offer their services for anyone
                who may need it.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I learned many things throughout this project. Not only did I learn about
                the design process, I also learned visual design principles. Such examples
                include layouts, typography and colors, and the importance of these principles
                to serve the user. Practicing these concepts throughout the semester culminated
                in the final prototype deliverable.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The design went through many ideas and iterations. Some concepts were not
                included in the final prototype. For example, some additional wireframes I
                worked on were:</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Grid layout to see and browse other users</li>
                    <li>Different home and profile user interface layouts</li>
                    <li>Mobile interface wireframe</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>These designs did not make the final prototype due to it being out of scope,
                overly complicated or visually unappealing.</p>

                Solo Project</h2>
                <br><br><br>

                <h3>Project Description:</h3>
                <br>
                <p>This project is a design project that hoped to incorporate third party
                websites' features into the League of Legends client itself. The problem I
                tried to solve with this was that information on in-game characters differed
                depending on different websites. My solution was to have these features within
                the client so users could have access to more accurate numbers. In addition,
                players could also gain a better understanding of the champions in terms of
                game-play. These solutions include features such as character win-rates,
                counter-picks and player-created guides for champions.</p><br><br><br>

                <h3>Design Process:</h3><br>
                <h4>1. Lean UX Canvas</h4><br>
                <p>The Lean UX Canvas by Jeff Gothelf was used to create the final deliverable.
                The steps I took were:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Business Problem - 3rd party website inaccuracy</li>
                    <li>Business Outcomes - More player engagement and activity</li>
                    <li>Target Users - League of Legends players</li>
                    <li>User Benefits - Game knowledge, optimization and learning</li>
                    <li>Solution Ideas - Player guides, character statistics</li>
                </ul>
                <br><br>
                <h4>2. Wireframing</h4><br>
                <p>The final deliverable is a wireframe of the features I wanted to bring to the
                League of Legends client. I was the sole designer as this was a solo project.
                Additionally, this deliverable was created through Figma.</p>

                    <h2>Fall, 2023<br>
                    Group Project</h2>
                    <br><br><br>

                    <h3>Project Description:</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>This is a design project that aimed to let UW Stevens Point students find
                    more accessible parking anywhere on campus. The problem was that students often
                    have trouble during the parking process such as buying permits or just searching
                    for good parking. The solutions we hypothesized was to create a mobile app to
                    streamline the process. Some features of the app would be map functionality,
                    browsing and selection of parking spots, in-app transactions.</p><br><br><br>

                    <h3>Design Process:</h3><br>
                    <h4>1. Analysis</h4><br>
                    <p>First, we analyzed the problem and discovered the pain points of the
                    current system. The permit acquisition process is inconvenient. Students
                    are placed on a wait list when trying to get a permit and are only allowed
                    in one parking lot.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h4>2. Solution Ideas</h4><br>
                    <p>An idea we developed was a user would be able to use the app to see what
                    parking spots on campus is available. Then, the user could book a specific
                    parking spot for a period of time. Additionally, they would also pay an immediate
                    fee for the reservation. Students could still be able to purchase parking permits
                    and use them as another option.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h4>3. User Scenario</h4><br>
                    <p>Using our solution ideas, we came up with a user scenario to see how a typical
                    user would interact with our hypothetical app.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h4>4. Wireframe Mockup</h4><br>
                    <p>Lastly, we created a wireframe mockup of how the app would look like. My role
                    on the project was to create these mockups and I did so with paper and pencil.</p>
                    <br><br><br>

                    <h3>Challenges & What I learned</h3><br>
                    <p>Initially, we were unsure of what would be appropriate for an app such as this.
                    We ended up overthinking and designing beyond the scope of the project. Ideas we
                    came up with were outside the app and were not relevant such as physical sensors at
                    parking locations. To scale it back, we focused on just the app itself and what features
                    it may have to serve the users.</p><br>
                    <p>Having worked on this, it taught me to redirect my focus even on a group project such
                    as this. Similar to writing a paper, it is easy to get sidetracked. The best way to combat
                    this is to take a step back and see if what was produced answers the problem
                    or question.</p>
